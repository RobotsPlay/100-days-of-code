# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resolved to undertake the challenge.

**Thoughts:** Taking inspiration from my son's distance kindergarten class, I'm going start with a prototype for an alphabet exercise in React.js

Present illustrations with matching words with a letter missing. User must enter the missing letter.

**Maybe for later?** A flash card app for helping to learn sight words. Could later adapt for other things like math facts.

### Day 2: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added speech synthesis using `SpeechSynthesis` api and a nice, slabby font to the exercise word.

**Thoughts:** I misspelled speech in my app code. :(
