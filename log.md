# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resolved to undertake the challenge.

**Thoughts:** Taking inspiration from my son's distance kindergarten class, I'm going start with a prototype for an alphabet exercise in React.js

Present illustrations with matching words with a letter missing. User must enter the missing letter.

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing yet, it's not even the first day!
