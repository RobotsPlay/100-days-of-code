# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Resolved to undertake the challenge.

**Thoughts:** Taking inspiration from my son's distance kindergarten class, I'm going start with a prototype for an alphabet exercise in React.js

Present illustrations with matching words with a letter missing. User must enter the missing letter.

**Maybe for later?** A flash card app for helping to learn sight words. Could later adapt for other things like math facts.

### Day 1: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up React project, made basic framework with exercise and frame components with switching controls. Set up basic styling structure and threw it up on Netlify

### Day 2: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added speech synthesis using `SpeechSynthesis` api and a nice, slabby font to the exercise word.

**Thoughts:** I misspelled speech in my app code. :(


### Day 3: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Split exercise word into single letter spans, replacing check letter with an input. Added validation to see if typed in letter is correct. Had to remove the slabby font because the baseline was really wonky.


### Day 4: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added exercise wide scoring and score display. Stubbed out buttons for final submission.


### Day 5: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added some illustrations to the slides, fixed some layout issues, slowed down the speech.

**Thoughts:** I'm really not happy with the way the height jumps up an down on mobile when the keyboard actvivates and deactives. My thought is to have the letters be multiple choice and answers are done with drag and drop.



### Day 6: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Greatly improved the UX by swapping form input to be a keyboard event driven span. Added letter buttons for mobile.


### Day 7: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added intro screen and final screen, tweaked buttons and several styles.

**Thoughts:** I think I've gone as far with this one as I'm gonna go.

### Day 11: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started another Nier themed pen on CodePen. This time it's the title screen. I set up the title logo, the inital menue items and the canvas-based static star field from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/better-programming/fun-with-html-canvas-lets-create-a-star-field-a46b0fed5002).

**Thoughts:** I got the font from [The Fonts Magazine](https://thefontsmagazine.com/font/nier-automata-font/#:~:text=The%20Nier%20Automata%20is%20an,released%20on%20March%2017%2C%202017.&text=The%20font%20used%20for%20the,basically%20ITC%20Benguiat%20Book%20Font.) so I can look at animation the title graphic.
